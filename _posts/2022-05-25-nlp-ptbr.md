I provided datasets to support natural language processing in Brazilian Portuguese. The data is accessible in Kaggle:

[words-in-portuguese-br-and-emotions](https://www.kaggle.com/antoniomenezes/words-in-portuguese-br-and-emotions){:target="_blank"}


![ISEAR (pt_BR)](/assets/img/data-original-1100x232.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

In addition, during my specialization course, I performed the translation of the ISEAR corpus (that contains emotion labels) to Brazilian Portuguese. The data is also available in Kaggle:
